fake-iris-backend
=================
Faking (iris) restful api server so whole web application can be demoed as static pages (with hash-router, github pages does not support SPA)

### To tackle
- Web database adapter
- wrapped fetch
- special treatment on backend api routing (aka. do not do backend routing, use lookup table instead)
- Webassembly build (so it looks good)
